This PR adds NPM version template resolution support to the generate-env.js script.

## Changes:
- Added `--npm-version` command line option
- Added NPM version reading logic using child_process
- Added template replacement for `###npmVersion###` placeholder
- Made necessary async function updates to support ES module imports
- Added `npmVersion` placeholder to environment.ts.template

## Usage:
```bash
node scripts/generate-env.js --npm-version
```

This allows the environment files to include the current NPM version in the generated configuration.

## Generated Output:
The npmVersion field will be included in both development and production environment files.
