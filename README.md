# Frontend Application

A comprehensive Angular 20 application with two main modules for financial management and plant care tracking.

## 🏦 Banking Module

The banking module helps you understand where your money goes each month. It reads your bank statements (CAMT files) and organizes all your transactions into clear categories so you can see your spending patterns and identify unusual expenses.
