# Banking Module - Understanding Your Monthly Finances

## What This Module Does

The banking module helps you understand where your money goes each month. It reads your bank statements (CAMT files) and organizes all your transactions into clear categories so you can see your spending patterns and identify unusual expenses.

## How It Works: From Bank File to Financial Insights

### 1. Upload Your Bank Statement
- You upload a CAMT file (this is just a standard bank statement format)
- The system reads all your transactions from the file

### 2. Automatic Categorization
The system automatically sorts every transaction into three categories:

**General Bookings (Usual Expenses)**
- Regular monthly bills and planned expenses
- Things like rent, insurance, subscriptions
- Expected costs that you can plan for

**Daily Costs (Everyday Spending)**
- Your day-to-day expenses
- Things like groceries, gas, coffee, shopping
- Variable spending that changes month to month

**Income**
- Money coming into your account
- Salary, transfers, refunds, etc.

### 3. Monthly Analysis
For each month, the system calculates:

**Total Expenses** = General Bookings + Daily Costs

**Financial Health Check**: The system compares your total expenses against your income
- If expenses are higher than income → Shows a red warning
- If expenses are lower than income → Shows normal blue display

### 4. Finding Cost Outliers
In each category, transactions are automatically sorted by amount:
- Largest transactions appear at the top
- This helps you quickly spot unusual or unexpectedly large expenses
- Easy to see if a particular purchase was much bigger than usual

## What You Can Learn From This

### Spot Problem Months
When expenses exceed income, you'll see a red alert telling you:
- "Your expenses are higher than your income this month!"
- This helps you identify months that need attention

### Understand Your Spending Patterns
- Compare your "General Bookings" across months to see if fixed costs are changing
- Look at "Daily Costs" to understand your variable spending habits
- See which months have higher or lower spending

### Identify Unusual Expenses
- The sorting shows your biggest expenses first
- Easy to spot transactions that don't belong or are unusually large
- Helps catch errors or fraudulent charges

### Track Income Changes
- See how your income varies month to month
- Compare income against expenses to understand your savings potential

## The Backup Feature

The system also lets you backup your cost data. This is useful for:
- Keeping historical records of your financial analysis
- Comparing year-over-year spending patterns
- Having a record even if you change banks or lose original statements

## Tips for Using This Module Effectively

1. **Upload Regularly**: Try to analyze each month's bank statement to stay on top of your finances

2. **Look for Patterns**: Compare several months to understand your typical spending behavior

3. **Investigate Outliers**: Always check large transactions that appear at the top of lists

4. **Pay Attention to Red Alerts**: These indicate months where you spent more than you earned

5. **Use the Backup**: Save your analysis periodically to build a financial history

This module turns confusing bank statements into clear, actionable insights about your financial health.
